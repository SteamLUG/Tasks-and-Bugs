SteamLUG Server Code
==============

Hey! This is the source for the site https://steamlug.org/ which helps expose
our small (~6000 users) community of Linux gamers on Steam to our community
events, share our awesome podcast, [SteamLUG Cast](https://steamlug.org/cast),
list our servers that are generously provided by community members and more.

If you think there could be a feature added, or that the code could be
improved, open an issue, we’ll discuss it and take you through a pull request.

As always, everything is still to be done, so jump in! ― [johndrinkwater](https://github.com/johndrinkwater).

Possible TODOs:
* Clan support for our DOTA, CS:GO, and Guns of Icarus:Online communities
* Game sessions to let people organise events outside of our usual slots
* Key giveaways (and anonymous Steam key drop-off) to help engagement
